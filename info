We make use of the YOLO v5 object detection model to process the numbers of cars, buses , trucks etc at any signal, and then we feed that data to a function that calculates 
the appropriate green signal time , based on traffic density and a few other parameters such as average crossing times. This helps in efficient regulation 
of traffic across junctions.

(The final implementation is in the file signalcountdown.py)

The time for each signal is shown in the RYG format in the form of a nested list.

We have included a 504 entry sample of the dataset used for training (actual size was 7481 for training, and 1599 for validation).

The working model was based off a simulation on tinkercad, that showed the signal switching process. (link in the word document).

Extensive working and implementation details are also in the word document.
